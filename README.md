## Why I made this ⏰

I'm a simple man. I use Google's Timer for my own deep work session.

Honestly, I thought it'd be a 2 hour thing. Took me much longer. Needed to learn some SVG animations and refresh my Math lol.

## Bugs & Contributing 🐛

I assume you've it up and running by yourself. I mean it's just React. No environment variables needed this time hehe.

If you find a bug, create an issue.

If you want to contribute, make sure an issue is already created and ASSIGNED to you. Don't waste your time making a PR that won't be merged.

If it's something that I think should be addressed, we can discuss the solution in the github issue, and then you can go ahead and make a PR.
